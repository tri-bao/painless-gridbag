26.01.2012 v1.0.6
- New features:
	+ Allow customizing anchor of any label: In previous versions, the painless-gridbag controls anchor
	  of all labels based on the attribute alignAllLabelsToRight of the config object. From now on, if you
	  want to anchor a label differently from the rest (for example: NORTH), use the new method in 
	  PainlessGridBagConfiguration: addLabelAnchor(JLabel lbl, int anchor)
- Bug fixes:
	+ Issue 1 (http://code.google.com/p/painless-gridbag/issues/detail?id=1)
		This issue only affects layouts that are using the following utility
			LayoutUtils.addButtonPanel(gbl, leftButtons, rightButtons)
		and only affects left buttons.
		To workaround this issue (in previous versions) while using the above method, you may have used
		the utility
			LayoutUtils.addButtonPanel(gbl, buttonConfig, leftButtons, rightButtons)
		and adjusting insets of the first left button.
		Now, when upgrading to this version (with this fix), you are recommended to check again all places
		where those 2 methods are used.
	+ Issue 2 (http://code.google.com/p/painless-gridbag/issues/detail?id=2)
		The original tooltip (the tooltip of the component) is now displayed inside the debug tooltip
